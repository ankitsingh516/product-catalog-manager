# Frontend Take-Home Assignment: Product Catalog Manager
## Key Requirements:

Develop a single-page application that allows users to browse and manage a catalog of products. The application should demonstrate core framework proficiency (React or Angular), state management, and clean component architecture.

## Core Features

1. **Product Listing & Filtering**
   -  Fetch product data from a mock API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or static JSON).
	 -  Display products in a responsive grid/list layout.
	 -	Implement client-side filtering by category and sorting by price/rating.
3. **Product Management Interface**
	 - Add a form to create new products with validation (e.g., name, price, category).
	 - Enable inline editing/deletion of existing products without page reload.
	 - Use framework-specific state management (React hooks, Angular services) to synchronize UI with data.
4. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness with at least one breakpoint.
	 - Add loading/error states for API interactions.
	 - Include hover/focus visual feedback for interactive elements.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Provide a GitHub repository with clear setup/run instructions
2. Timebox this assesment to 2-4 hours, it doesn't need to be fully completed but it should compile/run without errors
3. Include a brief write-up explaining key architectural decisions (optional)
